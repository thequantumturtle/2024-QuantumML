I"*<p>Amidst the quantum world, we pause and break,
Thanksgiving’s grace, a respite we partake.
From qubits’ dance and tensors’ cosmic flight,
We savor moments, grateful for the light.</p>

<p>A quantum course, a journey vast and deep,
But in this season’s warmth, we softly sleep.
With family and friends, we gather near,
In this Thanksgiving time, we hold them dear.</p>

<p>For while we delve in qubits’ endless spin,
The heart finds solace in the love within.
With gratitude, we cherish moments shared,
In this QML break, a soul repaired.</p>
